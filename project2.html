          I was the sole designer and producer for an academic annual project—a
          point-and-click adventure game with mini-games, featuring a cozy,
          pastel, and childlike aesthetic, but with subtle hints of mature
          narrative elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the producer, my responsibilities included planning and managing
          the entire development schedule, coordinating communication among team
          members, organizing workflow and documentation, and ensuring that all
          deadlines were met efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my role as the sole designer, I focused on level design, puzzle
          creation, narrative development, character design, and overall game
          aesthetics. I crafted engaging puzzles and mini-games that fit
          seamlessly within the story and style, while developing characters and
          narrative elements that balanced the childlike visual theme with
          mature storytelling.
