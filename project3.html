          <p>During my internship as a production assistant at Gammera Nest, I participated in over five yet-to-be-released projects, ranging from narrative adventures to titles towards kids or experimental approach. My main responsibilities included:</p>
    
          <p>- Tracking and documentation (minutes, deliverables lists, databases). Task management using tools such as Trello, Excel, and Miro..</p>
          <p>- Internal communication and coordination among multidisciplinary teams.</p>
          <p>- Support in design, particularly during pre-production and writing of GDDs.</p>
          <p>- Team organization and resource planning.</p>
          
          <p>Additionally, I proposed and implemented organizational improvements, helped facilitate transitions between projects, and provided both human and technical support at various stages of development. My approach is structured, proactive, and collaborative, with particular attention to clarity, empathy, and efficiency in creative environments.</p>
