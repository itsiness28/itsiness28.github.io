          As a Notion Consultant with several years of personal experience, I
          help individuals and professionals optimize their workflows using
          Notion. Recently, I worked with a university professor to organize and
          redesign their course dashboard. </p>
          <p>My responsibilities included:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>- Structuring course content and resources for easy access.</p> 
          <p>- Designing a clean, user-friendly interface based on the professor's aesthetic and needs.</p> 
          <p>- Providing support during the first weeks of class to ensure
          smooth adoption.</p> 
          <p>- Adapting the system as new needs emerged.</p> 
          <p></p>
          <p>This project combined technical setup with an understanding of personal
          workflow, resulting in a tailored and efficient Notion workspace.</p>
